          You can bet with the market odds, which will likely be matched immediately with
          existing orders on the order book, or set your own odds, which will likely go on
          the order book to wait for a matching order.

        <dd>
          The total volume of bets on this outcome.

        <dd>
          This is the fee set by the market creator, as a percentage of the winnings. A
          market fee of 1% would be 1ETH on a winning payout of 100 ETH.
