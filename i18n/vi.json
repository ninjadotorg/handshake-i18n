            "question": "Whatâs special about PEX? Why should i bet on one?",
            "answer": "It allows parties to directly bet against each other without going through a central authority or bookmaker. This makes it 100% anonymous, no signs up no downloads required. The management of bets and the settlement of winnings are carried out collectively by the blockchain network, protecting users from any single point of failure. You can also create your own prediction markets."

            "answer": "Yes! When creating your own bet, youâll enter the event youâre interested in and the outcome you want to bet on. Then, simply enter your stake and the odds you want. Then the PEX Engine will automatically find and match you with anyone that has an interest in the same event, and who accepts your odds."

            "question": "How do you police unsavory/illegal bets?",

        },
        {
            "question": "How does the system know the result of bets between people? Who acts as arbitrator and verifies one outcome vs. another at conclusion of contract?",
            "answer": "Ninja will soon have a completely decentralized solution for verifying the outcome and incentivizing truth telling (a DAO of reporters!). In the meantime, as we will launch just in time for the FIFA world cup, our team will use a public source (livescore.com) and act as the reporter."
        },
        {
            "question": "Where is the coin held?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Why should I bet on blockchain instead of using traditional methods?",
            "answer": "A decentralized prediction exchange will provide you the freedom to create your own odds and bet directly with anyone, offer you 100% ninja anonymity and guaranteed payouts."
        },
        {
            "question": "How about privacy and anonymity?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Do I need to pay any fees?",
            "answer": "There are two main types of fees: creator fees (for the ninja that creates the bet) and the network fee (a percentage of the creator fee, that goes towards maintaining the platform)."
        },
        {
            "question": "What do I need to do when the outcome is finalized?",
            "answer": "Nothing. If you win, your winnings will be automatically transferred to your account. If you lose, it will be someone elseâs account."
        },
        {
            "question": "Where can I find a match to bet on?",
            "answer": "On the homepage, youâll be able to browse ongoing bets and markets. If you canât find any you like, create your own!"

You, as the market creator, can set the market fee, the market closing time, the reporter of the outcome, and the reporting deadline.",

This can be in any fieldâââsports, politics, science, lifestyle, even weather and so on. The only limit here is your creativity. Each market is part of an on-chain smart contract. It has its own order book, makers and takers.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_ARCHITECTURE_3_HL": "Order Book",
    "WHITE_PAPER_ARCHITECTURE_3": "Each Prediction Market has its own order book. PEX Order Book manages all Support Outcome Orders (ask) and all Against Outcome Order (bid). It aggregates all orders with the same price (odds) into an entry on the order book.",

    "WHITE_PAPER_ARCHITECTURE_4_HL": "Matching Engine",
    "WHITE_PAPER_ARCHITECTURE_4_1": "PEX uses a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order book. Orders are executed in price-time priority. This means that it will match by price first, and if there are two orders with the same price, then it will match by time.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_ARCHITECTURE_4_2": "In some cases, the amount placed on either side is uneven, and the order will be partially filled. The remaining order will be matched with the next best price-then-time in the order book until the order is completely filled.",

    "WHITE_PAPER_PRIVACY_1": "PEX is not a mobile app. Itâs freely accessible on the mobile web. While native mobile apps sometimes have better UI/UX, they must be hosted by centralized app stores like Android Play Store or Apple App store. In our view, a more attractive UI is not an acceptable tradeoff for compromised privacy.",

    "WHITE_PAPER_PRIVACY_2_2": "PEX doesnât collect your personal information. You can use PEX with complete privacy. When you first open PEX, a public/private keypair will be created silently in the background and stored locally on your phone. The public key acts as your anonymous username, and the private key is your password. PEX doesnât have access to your private keyâââonly you do.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_PRIVACY_2_3": "Note that in the Profile Settings, we provide an option for the user to enter their email address. The purpose is not to collect your email, but for a better experience, especially in use cases related to payments. Itâs completely optional.",

    "WHITE_PAPER_PRIVACY_4": "Similar to stock and coin exchanges, the order book, sizes, odds, and time are public, but the order book doesnât disclose who the order makers and takers are. The order book records the bet anonymous parties place against each other, based on their opposing predictions of an event. Once the event concludes and the report is available, the escrowed funds are transferred automatically to the winner.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE": "Fees",
    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE_1": "There are two main types of fees: winning fee and network fee.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE_2": "The winning fee is set by the market creator, as a percentage of the total winnings of that market. Itâs entirely up to the market creator to set their own fees. Since PEX allows anyone to create a prediction market, we expect that the fees will be very competitive among markets. This is the best case scenario for users.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE_3": "The network fee is 20% of the creatorâs winning fee. This pays for engineering, infrastructure, and maintenance of the network. At the beginning, this will be undertaken by the Core Ninja Team. But we expect that over time we will decentralize the team and design a mechanism that opens it up to the entire community.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE_4": "Optionally, we are considering a referral fee for the market creator. The referral pool could be 10%âââ20% of the winning fee, which will help in adding a lot more users to the market.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SETTLEMENT": "Settlement",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SETTLEMENT_1": "The deeper we dive into building PEX, the more it seems that we have to initially strike a compromise between speed and decentralization, while always retaining security. In relation to settlement, which requires the report of the outcome to be available immediately after each event (i.e. a sports event), we will opt for speed, for now.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SETTLEMENT_2": "In the first release, the Core Ninja Team will assume the reporting role and report the outcome of all events. Weâre researching and designing a decentralized mechanism that will allow the community to report the outcomes.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SUMMARY": "Summary",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SUMMARY_1": "PEX is a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic prediction that allows parties to bet directly against each other without going through a central authority or bookmaker",
