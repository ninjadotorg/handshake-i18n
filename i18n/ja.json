    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE": "Fees",
    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE_1": "There are two main types of fees: winning fee and network fee.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE_2": "The winning fee is set by the market creator, as a percentage of the total winnings of that market. It’s entirely up to the market creator to set their own fees. Since PEX allows anyone to create a prediction market, we expect that the fees will be very competitive among markets. This is the best case scenario for users.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE_3": "The network fee is 20% of the creator’s winning fee. This pays for engineering, infrastructure, and maintenance of the network. At the beginning, this will be undertaken by the Core Ninja Team. But we expect that over time we will decentralize the team and design a mechanism that opens it up to the entire community.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_FEE_4": "Optionally, we are considering a referral fee for the market creator. The referral pool could be 10% — 20% of the winning fee, which will help in adding a lot more users to the market.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SETTLEMENT": "Settlement",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SETTLEMENT_1": "The deeper we dive into building PEX, the more it seems that we have to initially strike a compromise between speed and decentralization, while always retaining security. In relation to settlement, which requires the report of the outcome to be available immediately after each event (i.e. a sports event), we will opt for speed, for now.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SETTLEMENT_2": "In the first release, the Core Ninja Team will assume the reporting role and report the outcome of all events. We’re researching and designing a decentralized mechanism that will allow the community to report the outcomes.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SUMMARY": "Summary",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SUMMARY_1": "PEX is a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic prediction that allows parties to bet directly against each other without going through a central authority or bookmaker",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SUMMARY_2": "PEX is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls PEX and everyone can take part.",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SUMMARY_3": "PEX is open source at",
    "WHITE_PAPER_SUMMARY_4": "Build PEX with us. Join the conversation at",
    "WHITE_PAPER_END": "And it actually works",
    "WHITE_PAPER_END_1": "Hey, thanks for reading. Ninja will go live on the testnet on 5 June! We’re excited to hear your thoughts."
